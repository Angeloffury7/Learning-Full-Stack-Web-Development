MongoDB is used with Node

Why use a database instead of just saving to a file?
- Data persistence
- They can handle large amounts of data
- They provide tools for easy CRUD
- Security features and control access to data
- They scale well

MySQL vs SQL

SQL------------------
eg, mysql, postgres, oracle
Relational databases, consist of a pre-defined table/schema.

NoSQL----------------
eg, MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB
Newer, very diverse group, not much can be generalised about them.

Document Oriented Database (NoSQL db)-> They store information in JSON, XML, YAML etc
You don't have to follow some pre-defined schema, you can just take the information 
and store it.

                        BUT WHY MONGO??

Commonly used with Node and Express (MERN and MEAN)
It's easy to get started with (though it's difficult to truly master)
It plays really well with JavaScript
Strong community of developers.
