            WHAT IS MONGOOSE??
We have an application that interacts with our database and our Node app.

Object Data Mapper (ODM) -> makes data coming from Mongo into useful JS objects.


Using Mongoose
1. require it
2. run mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/dbName", {useNewUrlParse: true, useUnifiedTopology: true})
    Don't write localhost instead of the home address, it has been deprecated or something
    But if you run your file, the terminal will kind of hang.
3. .connect() returns a promise, so use then-catch
