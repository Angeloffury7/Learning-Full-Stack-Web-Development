            WHAT IS MONGOOSE??
We have an application that interacts with our database and our Node app.

Object Data Mapper (ODM) -> makes data coming from Mongo into useful JS objects.


Using Mongoose
1. require it
2. run mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/dbName", {useNewUrlParse: true, useUnifiedTopology: true})
    Don't write localhost instead of the home address, it has been deprecated or something
    But if you run your file, the terminal will kind of hang. It's not an error, it's expecting us to write some commands in the script.js
3. .connect() returns a promise, so use then-catch


        MODELS
1. Models are JS classes that represent data in a collection in our db
2. A model is derived from a schema -> a mapping of keys from Mongo to different data types in JavaScript, eg. title: String, id: Number, hidden: boolean
3. We make a model because a schema on its own is not related to mongodb, it's just JavaScript. A model is what tells our db what the incoming data will be like.

*** RUN THE MONGOOSE COMMANDS IN THE NODE REPL, NOT MONGOSH

Movie.insertMany() -> async function, returns a promise, with this we don't have to do .save()

FINDING 
find() -> it's not really a promise, they are then-able objects (use then/catch)

UPDATING 
It doesn't return what was updated, it just returns how many were updated.
