            WHAT IS MONGOOSE??
We have an application that interacts with our database and our Node app.

Object Data Mapper (ODM) -> makes data coming from Mongo into useful JS objects.


Using Mongoose
    npm i mongoose
1. require it
2. run mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/dbName", {useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true})
    Don't write localhost instead of the home address, it has been deprecated.

    But if you run your file, the terminal will kind of hang. It's not an error, it's expecting us to write some commands in the script.js
3. .connect() returns a promise, so use then-catch


                                    MODELS
1. Models are JS classes that represent data in a collection in our db
2. A model is derived from a schema. We make a model because a schema on its own is not related to mongodb, it's just JavaScript. A model is what tells our db what the incoming data will be like.

A schema is just a blueprint, it does nothing. A model is a JavaScript class that represents a collection inside our DB.

*** RUN THE MONGOOSE COMMANDS IN THE NODE REPL, NOT MONGOSH

Movie.insertMany() -> async function, returns a promise, with this we don't have to do .save()

FINDING 
find() -> it's not really a promise, they are then-able objects (use then/catch)

Easiest way - use async/await.

UPDATING 
It doesn't return what was updated, it just returns how many were updated.
