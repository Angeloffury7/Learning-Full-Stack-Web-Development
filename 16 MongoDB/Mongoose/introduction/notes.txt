            WHAT IS MONGOOSE??
We have an application that interacts with our database and our Node app.

Object Data Mapper (ODM) -> makes data coming from Mongo into useful JS objects.


Using Mongoose
1. require it
2. run mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/dbName", {useNewUrlParse: true, useUnifiedTopology: true})
    Don't write localhost instead of the home address, it has been deprecated or something
    But if you run your file, the terminal will kind of hang.
3. .connect() returns a promise, so use then-catch


        MODELS
1. Models are JS classes that represent data in a collection in our db
2. A model is derived from a schema -> a mapping of keys from Mongo to different data types in JavaScript, eg. title: String, id: Number, hidden: boolean
3. We make a model because a schema on its own is not related to mongodb, it's just JavaScript. A model is what 

*** RUN THE MONGOOSE COMMANDS IN THE NODE REPL, NOT MONGOSH

movies.insertMany() -> async function, returns a promise, with this we don't have to do .save()

FINDING 
find() -> it's not really a promise, they are then-able objects (use then/catch)
