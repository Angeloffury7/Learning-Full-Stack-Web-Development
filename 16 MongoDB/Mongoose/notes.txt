                                MONGOOSE

Till now, we interact with our database by writing code in the Mongo shell. How do we connect a Node app to MongoDB?
There are drivers which connect mongo to programming languages, like C++, JS, Rust

We will use Mongoose! Object Data/Document Mapper (ODM) -> It maps documents coming from a database into usable Javascript objects.
Mongoose helps us model our applciation and define a schema. We can build complex queries as well.

For SQL databases, we use Object Relational Model (ORM)

> INSTALLING MONGOOSE
It's an NPM package. KEEP THE DOCS OPEN

useNewUrlParser, useUnified -> enables the new mongodb url parser logic

> mongoose.connect() statement returns a promise, so we can chain .then() and .catch()

* If you do .load script.js, it will print a statement infinitely, this is a bug!
For now, use node -i -e "$(< script.js)"
