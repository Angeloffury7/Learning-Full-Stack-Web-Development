Drivers -> These are ways to connect MongoDB to languages like C++, Rust

For Javascript, it's a tool called Mongoose
It's an ODM -> Object Document Mapper (it converts data coming from database into usable JavaScript objects)
We can define a pre-set schema and enforce it.

For SQL databases, we have ORM -> Object Relation Mapper (takes SQL data and maps it for programming languages)

Don't use .load script.js
Use node -i -e "$(< index.js)" in Bash

Schema -> A blueprint of the data, hidden: data, name: String
