To add complicated validations, set property to an object, and we can add built-in validations
eg, required

If you find a field which isn't in the schema, it will just ignore that filed and add the fields that 
are in the schema

> There are options for your schema. required, default, immutable.
> Things you can apply to strings -> lowercase, uppercase, trim, minLength, maxLength, enum
 match = set patterns for your strings
> Number -> min, max, enum
> Date -> min, max

Maybe we want our products to have an array of categories ["Outdoors" , "Cycling"]

BUT OUR SCHEMA WON'T VALIDATE UPDATES, we need to explicitly tell mongoose to validate it, {runValidators: true}

* If you want the new object printed out after updating, {new: true}
