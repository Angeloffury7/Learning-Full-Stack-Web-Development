                            TEMPLATING

On Reddit, all subreddits follow a pattern -> Name of subreddit - join
                                                Card showing members vs active members
Even though colors, themes sizes might be different, they are fundamentally similar. We don't need to create separate files for each subreddit, 
we can create a template.

1. They are like madlibs (look them up)
2. Instead of writing static HTML code, we can embed information and logic (conditionally show/hide something)
    eg, If user is not logged in, show sign up and log in button
    but if they are, don't show us these buttons.

3. We can use many tools/templating engines for this (handlebars, jade etc), but we will use EJS (embedded javascript) because it is very popular, and importantly
    it uses Javascript syntax, unlike other engines.

4. How do we tell our app to use EJS?
    app.set(property, value)
    app.set("view engine", "ejs");
    npm install ejs

5. By default, express is going to assume that our templates are in a folder called 'views'. We need to make that folder.
    You can change it tho. 

6. In views folder, your template needs to end in .ejs 
7. EJS is just standard HTML, but it has extra features

8. in your app.get(), use res.render('file') , don't need to write .ejs 

9. EJS takes our template and runs all the logic and spits out HTML.

10. *** EJS will look for the views folder from where we run the script, not where the script is located.

11. If you want to be able the code from anywhere, you should change the views directory. Right now, views directory is process.cwd()
    We want whereourfileislocated/views 

12. path -> built-in module in express


                                EJS Syntax 
1. Tags -> <%= Evaluates and outputs the value into the HTML %>
2. Use EJS syntax to just display stuff, don't write logic in the tags
    You can pass a second argument to res.render to use variables, it must be an object { variable: value }
    If you just want to pass the value, just write { value }


                                Conditionals in EJS 
<% %> 
 <% if(bubbles % 2 == 0) { %>
        <h2>That is an even number!</h2>
    <% } else {%>
        <h2>That is an odd number!</h2>
    <% } %> 
Every line of javascript must have the <%> around it, no need for that in lines where HTML is present.


                                Looping in EJS 

We use templates for looking, to create very similar content. 
for eg, similar looking posts in a subreddit 


                                
                                Creating subreddit web pages (advanced) 

We have a json file with data of 3 subreddits, and if we go to /soccer, we want to render the soccer subreddit etc. 
How do we do this?

> require the file
> Take the subreddit name that you grabbed from the request and match it against data.json.
> const data = redditData[subreddit];   //returns the object of that subreddit.
> Since data is an object, we could pass the entire object and use it as data.name, data.subsribers 
    Instead, use the spread operator!
    { ...data } -> { name: idk, subscribers: lol, ...}
    If you recall, this is exactly how you pass variables to an ejs file! So now you can use name, subscribers etc as VARIABLES!

> If you have a list of posts, use a for...of loop 


                                SERVING STATIC FILES 

It refers to serving CSS and JS files, that we want to include in the response to the owner. We need to use express.static() -> it's a middleware
middleware ? It doesn't care about the route/request, it's going to run during every single request. We pass in the folder, that we want to serve our assets from.

> The folder name doesn't have to be public, it's just the naming convention.

app.use(express.static('public'));
> Make the directory inside the parent folder.
> In your EJS, make a regular link tag for styles. You don't have to write /public/styles.css, because the folder isn't served, the contents are!

> To be able to serve your assets from anywhere, as like in views, write app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
