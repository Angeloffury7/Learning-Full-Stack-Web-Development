REFER TO THE REACT DOCS, THEY ARE AMAZING

(...Basic React stuff)

Components are functions that return UI. In React, you NEED to capitalize your component 
names.

When exporting multiple things from a single file, pass them as a object and remove "default".
But it's not preferable to export more than 1 component from one file

JSX -> HTML inside your JavaScript

converting HTML to JSX => 
1. Return a single root element
    To get around this, use <> </> as a wrapper (these are called fragments)

2. you can't write "class" to give classes to your HTML elements, use className=""

3. Whenever using inline CSS or attributes (onClick), they must be camel-cased.

To use expressions/variables, use {}. to hard-code stuff, use ""

4. style: {{}}, outer bracket means that it must escape jsx, the inner bracket means it's a object.

IN REACT, YOU MUST PASS STYLES AS AN OBJECT
