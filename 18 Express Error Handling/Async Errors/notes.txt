                        ASYNC ERRORS!

What if we get errors in Mongoose errors? What if we leave our newProduct from blank? That will crash the app.

All model methods take time and are async. If we look for a product that doesn't exist, Mongoose won't throw an error.

We can simply add an if-else block.
