                        HANDLING ERRORS IN EXPRESS APPS

Types of errors ->
    Dev errors, syntax errors, runtime errors.
    API being down, mongoose validation errors, incomplete data from a form.

Right now, if an error is generated, we ARE getting a response, but we didn't specify what status code
to respond with, what content to respond with.

This is the default express error handling. It looks for an error object, looks for statusCode and statusMessage in that 
error object.

                        DEFINING CUSTOM ERROR HANDLERS
A middleware function, an error-handling function must have (err, req, res, next)
Put this in the last, after your middlewares and API routes.

If we go to /error, or /secret w/o password, we will get the error message.


*** WHEN WE DO NEXT(ERR), WE ARE PASSING THIS TO THE NEXT ERROR-HANDLING MW.
    NEXT() CALLS THE NEXT NON-ERROR HANDLING ERROR

                            CUSTOM ERROR CLASS
