                        REDUCE

1. Reduces an array to a single value, how it does that is upto us.
    
    [3,5,7,9, 11].reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
        return accumulator + currentValue
    })

    //35

    -> Accumulator function

2. Specify a starting point as another argument in function.

    which is commonly done in React.


but for now, don't use arrow functions with this, use regular functions instead.
