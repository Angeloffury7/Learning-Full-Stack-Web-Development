                        MIDDLEWARE
What is Middleware?
They are functions that run during the request/response lifecycle. Run between the time request enters Express
and the Response leaves express.

Each MW object has access to req/res objects. When a request comes in and we hit the first middleware, that MW
can end the cycle by res.send(), or it can call the next MW.

                    MORGAN - AN EXTERNAL MIDDLEWARE
Helps us log https request info to our terminal. To use Morgan as a MW, we have to tell our middleware.
It waits until the response goes before it logs the details, comes at the end.

                    DEFINING OUR OWN MIDDLEWARE

app.get("/", function(req, res, NEXT) {
    next(); refers to the next middleware and executes it.
})
