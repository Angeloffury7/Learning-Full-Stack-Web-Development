                                WHAT ARE COOKIES?
Cookies are little bits of information that are stores in a user's browser when browsing a particular
website.

Once a cookie is set, a user's browser will send the cookie on every subsequent request to the site.

Let's say, "color": "teal". The user's browser is going to take that info and store. on subsequent requests, when 
the browser sees that color: teal, it's going to include that information.

Cookies are just a name: value pair

Session management (we're going to talk about it.)
Personalisation (tracking whether user wants dark mode or light mode)

Using this, we make HTTP 'stateful'

                                SETTING AND PARSING COOKIES
We have set a cookie. Now, to retrieve this cookie, we need to use a cookie parser.
In Node.js, we use an npm package called cookie-parser and we find it in req.cookies
