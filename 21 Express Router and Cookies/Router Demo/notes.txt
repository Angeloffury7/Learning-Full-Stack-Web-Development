                                    EXPRESS ROUTES
We can write routes like we have been, but what if we have a lot of routes or a lot of nested routes? Use Express Router

We can essentially move our routes to different files.

We have made a routes folder, added a shelters.js file, which will handle all routes matching /shelters
> We have to create an Express router object, then attach all our routes to it. Then export it.

in app.js, require this file. Then we have to explicitly tell express to use this router.

app.use("/shelter", router) -> specifies the prefix of the routes, router specifies which router to use.

> You can add in your own middleware! How do you make sure your middleware only works on a specific route?
Do router.use() in your admin.js, it will protect every route.
