Object Prototypes -> Objects can have a prototype (a template)

* Arrays are objects in JavaScript. But in an array object, we don't see any of the methods listed.
They are inside the [[Prototype]] property. It's a property that references the template object for arrays (prototype).
 Instead of defining all of these methods everytime we make an array object.
for eg, the document.body object. It has a reference to the HTMLBodyElement prototype.

> To view the array prototype, Array.prototype

You can add your own function to a prototype. for eg, String.prototype.grumpus = () => alert('idk'). Obviously, this goes away when you refresh the page

[[Prototype]] is the reference to the prototype, Array.prototype is the actual prototype object.
