associating each product to a farm to this farmerShop clone

1. embedding products is a no-no, because we may want a page where we can see all
 products

2. We will have a 2-way relationship, we want to see a farm's products, and on products we want
    to see on which farm it is available.

Just adding functionality to create a farm, nothing new...
