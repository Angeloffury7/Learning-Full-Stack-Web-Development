Make sure you are comfortable with arrow functions, spread, destructuring
etc.

React basics, Vite, props, events, hooks, forms, material UI, component designs, react patterns

        REACT
Front-end library that helps us build UI. VERY popular
UI from components -> small individual pieces that we assemble to build a website.

react.dev -> official docs

Component -> function that combines logic, HTML etc

You can nest components inside each other, package it together and use this inside another component

React is more of an ecosystem, so we want a server, webpack, babel etc
For now, use code sandbox

public directory -> don't touch this file, it has index.html which is our main file. We render all our React
                    code in the empty div.
src -> we write our code here

How are we writing HTML inside JavaScript?

function Header() { 
    return (html)
}
This function knows how to render itself

> JSX syntax extension for JS, allows to write HTML-like markup inside JS which must be transpiled.
> Babel transpiles JSX and turns it into real JS.
