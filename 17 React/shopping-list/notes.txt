    "Missing "key" prop for element in iterator"
    Basically, we need to add a unique identifier for each element so that React can track it.
    If we fetch data from db, we will have an _id field, for now, add your own key
    You can even use the name as the key, use a library for a unique id etc.

Setting up event-handlers
> With Vanilla JS, we use a ton of querySelectors

In React, what if we want to add an eventListener for click? Use inline eventListener
> You can use any of the DOM events, just be sure that EVERY TRIGGER IS CAMEL-CASED

What if we need to access to the event object?
> As in JS, submitting a form refreshes the page
> Our event handler is automatically passed the event object

Working with forms is much more complicated, there's going to be a dedicated section to them later on.
